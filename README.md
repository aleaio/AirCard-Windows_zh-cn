## Features

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting & Driver Repair (If Nothing Works)

> [!TIP]
> **iPhone not detected, AirTraffic sync hangs, or operation fails?**  
> Corrupted or conflicting Apple USB drivers on Windows are the #1 root cause.
> 1. Download and install **[3uTools](https://www.3u.com/)**.
> 2. **Disconnect your iPhone** from your PC.
> 3. In 3uTools, go to **Toolbox ➔ Repair Driver**.
> 4. Click **Repair Now** and wait for the Apple driver reinstallation to finish.
> 5. Reconnect your unlocked iPhone, tap **Trust**, and launch **AirCard**.

## How to Customize Apple Wallet Cards
1. Connect your iPhone to your PC via USB and ensure it is unlocked.
2. In AirCard, stay on the **Wallet** tab and click **Scan**.
3. On your iPhone:
   - Open **Apple Wallet** (or double-click the Side/Power button).
   - Tap the card you want to customize.
   - AirCard intercepts and saves the card hash automatically. Click **Stop**.
4. Click **Choose Image...** to pick your artwork (PNG, JPG, or WebP — automatically center-cropped and scaled to `1536 × 969`).
5. Click **Apply Card Skin**.
6. Force-close the **Wallet** app on your iPhone from the App Switcher (swipe up from bottom, then swipe Wallet away) and reopen Wallet to see your new card!

## How to Apply Lockscreen Passcode Themes (.passthm)
1. Switch to the **Passcode** tab in AirCard.
2. Click **Choose .passthm...** and select any `.passthm` package (Cowabunga or Nugget).
3. Select your target iOS version cache:
   - **Auto (TelephonyUI-10)** — iOS 18+ (Default)
   - **TelephonyUI-9** — iOS 16 - 17
   - **TelephonyUI-8** — Legacy iOS
4. Click **Apply Passcode Theme**.
5. Lock your iPhone screen or open Phone dialer to see your new custom passcode keypad buttons!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Turn OFF Bold Text:**  
> On your iPhone, go to **Settings ➔ Display & Brightness** and make sure **Bold Text** is turned **OFF**. If Bold Text is enabled, iOS ignores cached dialer button graphics and renders system vector fonts instead.
